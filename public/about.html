<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Mikias Yimenu, a passionate software engineering student with a big dream: to work for a company like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon. </p>

<p>I was born and raised in Ethiopia, starting my education at Bahir Dar Academy and graduating from Akaki Adventist School. I then pursued higher education at Injibara University, where I discovered my love for coding.  Now, I'm studying software engineering at HiLCoE School of Computer Science and Technology. </p>

<p>I'm currently diving into Fullstack Web Development, thanks to Angela Yu's fantastic course. I love how she makes learning fun and engaging! I'm eager to complete the course and put my skills to work in the real world. </p>

<p>Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family: my mom, Mulu Nibretie, who is an accountant at Gelan Tena Tabiya, and my dad, Yimenu Admass, an academic dean at Debrezeyt Meserete Kristos College.  I have one brother, Bekalu Yimenu.</p>
